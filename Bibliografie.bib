	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or {VQE}), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The {VQE} may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual {VQE} components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the {VQE} to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which {VQE} suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the {VQE} to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

	abstract = {When you learn undergraduate quantum mechanics, it starts out being all about wavefunctions and Hamiltonians, finding energy eigenvalues and eigenstates, calculating measurement probabilities, and so on. If your physics education was anything like mine, at some point a mysterious jump occurs. People teaching more advanced subjects, like quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, or quantum optics, start “imposing canonical commutation relations” on various field operators. Any student quickly realizes that “imposing canonical commutation relations” is extremely important, but, speaking personally, at the time I found it quite mysterious exactly what people meant by this phrase. It’s only in the past few years that I’ve obtained a satisfactory understanding of how this works, and understood why I had such trouble in the first place. These notes contain two parts. The first part is a short tutorial explaining the Fermionic canonical commutation relations ({CCRs}) from an elementary point of view: the different meanings they can have, both mathematical and physical, and what mathematical consequences they have. I concentrate more on the mathematical consequences than the physical in these notes, since having a good grasp of the former seems to make it relatively easy to appreciate the latter, but not so much vice versa. I may come back to the physical aspect in some later notes. The second part of the notes describes a beautiful application of the Fermionic {CCRs} known as the {JordanWigner} transform. This powerful tool allows us to map a system of interacting qubits onto an equivalent system of interacting Fermions, or, vice versa, to map a system of Fermions onto a system of qubits. Why is this kind of mapping interesting? It’s interesting because it means that anything we understand about one type of system (e.g., Fermions) can be immediately applied to learn something about the other type of system (e.g., qubits). I’ll describe an application of this idea, taking what appears to be a very complicated one-dimensional model of interacting spin12 particles, and showing that it is equivalent to a simple model of non-interacting Fermions. This enables us to solve for the energy spectrum and eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian. This has, of course,},

	abstract = {The recent developments of quantum computing present potential novel pathways for quantum chemistry, as the increased computational power of quantum computers could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve electronic structure problems. Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been proposed (e.g. Quantum Phase Estimation) but the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices ({NISQ}) motivated the development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver ({VQE}) algorithm was successfully introduced as an effective method to compute the ground state energy of small molecules. The current study investigates the Folded Spectrum ({FS}) method as an extension to the {VQE} algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target energy, using the same ansatz as for the ground state calculation. Inspired by the variance-based methods from the Quantum Monte Carlo literature, the {FS} method minimizes the energy variance, thus requiring a computationally expensive squared Hamiltonian. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by employing a Pauli grouping procedure, identifying sets of commuting Pauli strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant reduction of the computational cost. We apply the {FS}-{VQE} method to small molecules (H\$\_2\$,{LiH}), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical accuracy on ideal quantum simulators.},

Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

In this paper, we explore the computational challenges of implementing {QPE} algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) machines using the {IBM} Q Experience (e.g., the {IBMQX}4, 5-qubit quantum computing hardware platform). Our experimental results indicate that the accuracy of finding the phase using these {QPE} algorithms is severely constrained by the {NISQ} computer's physical characteristics such as coherence time and error rates. To mitigate these physical limitations, we propose implementing a modified solution by reducing the number of controlled rotation gates and phase shift operations, thereby increasing the accuracy of the finding phase in near-term quantum computers.},

With the standard correspondence between the Foch space of \$m\$ {LFMs} and the Hilbert space of \$m\$ qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes \$O(m)\$ qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to \$O({\textbackslash}log m)\$ and a constant, respectively. Nearest-neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of {LFMs}. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.},

	abstract = {Variational algorithms are a promising paradigm for utilizing near-term quantum devices for modeling electronic states of molecular systems. However, previous bounds on the measurement time required have suggested that the application of these techniques to larger molecules might be infeasible. We present a measurement strategy based on a low-rank factorization of the two-electron integral tensor. Our approach provides a cubic reduction in term groupings over prior state-of-the-art and enables measurement times three orders of magnitude smaller than those suggested by commonly referenced bounds for the largest systems we consider. Although our technique requires execution of a linear-depth circuit prior to measurement, this is compensated for by eliminating challenges associated with sampling nonlocal Jordan–Wigner transformed operators in the presence of measurement error, while enabling a powerful form of error mitigation based on efficient postselection. We numerically characterize these benefits with noisy quantum circuit simulations for ground-state energies of strongly correlated electronic systems.},

In particular, it is necessary to study variational quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, which are executable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) computers. Evaluations of observables appear frequently in the variational quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for {NISQ} computers. By speeding up the evaluation of observables, it is possible to realize a faster algorithm and save resources of quantum computers. Grouping of observables with separable measurements has been conventionally used, and the grouping with entangled measurements has also been proposed recently by several teams. In this paper, we show that entangled measurements enhance the efficiency of evaluation of observables, both theoretically and experimentally, by taking into account the covariance effect, which may affect the quality of evaluation of observables. We also propose using a part of entangled measurements for grouping to keep the depth of extra gates constant. Our proposed method is expected to be used in conjunction with other related studies. We hope that entangled measurements would become crucial resources, not only for joint measurements but also for quantum information processing.},

It minimizes quantum resource requirements both by co-processing with a classical processor and by structuring computation into many subproblems. Each quantum subproblem involves a separate state preparation terminated by the measurement of one Pauli string. However, the number of such Pauli strings scales as \$N{\textasciicircum}4\$ for typical problems of interest--a daunting growth rate that poses a serious limitation for emerging applications such as quantum computational chemistry. We introduce a systematic technique for minimizing requisite state preparations by exploiting the simultaneous measurability of partitions of commuting Pauli strings. Our work encompasses algorithms for efficiently approximating a {MIN}-{COMMUTING}-{PARTITION}, as well as a synthesis tool for compiling simultaneous measurement circuits. For representative problems, we achieve 8-30x reductions in state preparations, with minimal overhead in measurement circuit cost. We demonstrate experimental validation of our techniques by estimating the ground state energy of deuteron on an {IBM} Q 20-qubit machine. We also investigate the underlying statistics of simultaneous measurement and devise an adaptive strategy for mitigating harmful covariance terms.},

These algorithms aim to find approximate solutions to quantum problems by optimizing a parametrized quantum circuit using a classical optimization algorithm. A successful {VQA} requires fast and reliable classical optimization algorithms. Understanding and optimizing how off-the-shelf optimization methods perform in this context is important for the future of the field. In this work, we study the performance of four commonly used gradient-free optimization methods [sequential least-squares quadratic programming, constrained optimization by linear approximations, the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy ({CMA}-{ES}), and the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation ({SPSA})] to find ground-state energies of a range of small chemistry and material science problems. We test a telescoping sampling scheme (where the accuracy of the cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer is increased as the optimization converges) for all methods, demonstrating mixed results across our range of optimizers and problems chosen. We further hyperparameter tune two of the four optimizers ({CMA}-{ES} and {SPSA}) across a large range of models and demonstrate that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, {CMA}-{ES} is competitive with and sometimes outperforms {SPSA} (which is not observed in the absence of hyperparameter tuning). Finally, we investigate the ability of an optimizer to beat the “sampling-noise floor” given by the sampling noise of each cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer. Our results demonstrate the necessity for tailoring and hyperparameter tuning known optimization techniques for inherently noisy variational quantum algorithms and that the variational landscape that one finds in a {VQA} is highly problem and system dependent. This provides guidance for future implementations of these algorithms in experiments.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Our ansatz, along with the {VQE} method are shown to be able to reproduce exact energy values for the ground state and first and second excited states. We compare a classical shell model code, the values obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian after qubit mapping, and a noiseless simulated ansatz+{VQE} simulation. The exact agreement between classical and qubit-mapped diagonalisation shows the correctness of our method, and the high accuracy of the simulation means that the ansatz is suitable to allow a full reconstruction of the full nuclear wave function.},

The wavefunction parametrization should be expressive enough, i.e. represent the true eigenstate of a quantum system for some choice of parameter values. On the other hand, it should be trainable, i.e. the number of parameters should not grow exponentially with the size of the system. Here, we apply {VQE} to the problem of finding ground and excited state energies of the odd-odd nucleus \${\textasciicircum}6\$Li. We study the effects of ordering fermionic excitation operators in the unitary coupled clusters ansatz on the {VQE} algorithm convergence by using only operators preserving the \$J\_z\$ quantum number. The accuracy is improved by two order of magnitude in the case of descending order. We first compute optimal ansatz parameter values using a classical state-vector simulator with arbitrary measurement accuracy and then use those values to evaluate energy eigenstates of \${\textasciicircum}6\$Li on a superconducting quantum chip from {IBM}.

One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational {HQC} algorithms.},

	abstract = {We study the performance of permanent states (the bosonic counterpart of the Slater determinant state) as approximating functions for bosons, with the intention to develop variational methods based upon them. For a system of \$N\$ identical bosons, a permanent state is constructed by taking a set of \$N\$ arbitrary (not necessarily orthonormal) single-particle orbitals, forming their product and then symmetrizing it. It is found that for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with the periodic boundary condition and at unit filling, the exact ground state can be very well approximated by a permanent state, in that the permanent state has high overlap (at least 0.96 even for 12 particles and 12 sites) with the exact ground state and can reproduce both the ground state energy and the single-particle correlators to high precision. For a generic model, we have devised a greedy algorithm to find the optimal set of single-particle orbitals to minimize the variational energy or maximize the overlap with a target state. It turns out that quite often the ground state of a bosonic system can be well approximated by a permanent state by all the criterions of energy, overlap, and correlation functions. And even if the error is apparent, it can often be remedied by including more configurations, i.e., by allowing the variational wave function to be a combination of multiple permanent states. The algorithm is used to study the stability of a two-particle system, with great success. All these suggest that permanent states are very effective as variational wave functions for bosonic systems, and hence deserve further studies.},

	abstract = {Modern experimental developments in condensed matter and ultracold atom physics present formidable challenges to theorists. This book provides a pedagogical introduction to quantum field theory in many-particle physics, emphasizing the applicability of the formalism to concrete problems. This second edition contains two new chapters developing path integral approaches to classical and quantum nonequilibrium phenomena. Other chapters cover a range of topics, from the introduction of many-body techniques and functional integration, to renormalization group methods, the theory of response functions, and topology. Conceptual aspects and formal methodology are emphasized, but the discussion focuses on practical experimental applications drawn largely from condensed matter physics and neighboring fields. Extended and challenging problems with fully worked solutions provide a bridge between formal manipulations and research-oriented thinking. Aimed at elevating graduate students to a level where they can engage in independent research, this book complements graduate level courses on many-particle theory.},
